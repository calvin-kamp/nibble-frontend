/**
 * Daily energy needs from an additive net-MET model.
 *
 * Expenditure is assembled from three parts rather than a single activity multiplier:
 *
 * 1. Basal metabolic rate via Mifflin-St Jeor (1990) — resting expenditure predicted from
 *    weight, height, age and sex. The most accurate of the widely used predictive equations
 *    for a general population; it underestimates at very low body weight and for people
 *    carrying unusual muscle mass.
 * 2. Everyday movement — step count converted to walking minutes at a fixed cadence, priced
 *    with the walking MET from the Compendium of Physical Activities.
 * 3. Training — the same arithmetic per session, averaged from a weekly schedule down to a
 *    daily figure.
 *
 * Parts 2 and 3 use MET − 1, not MET. One MET is resting expenditure, which the basal rate
 * already accounts for; without the subtraction every active minute is counted twice.
 *
 * The thermic effect of food is a share of what is eaten, not of what is burned, so
 * maintenance is the sum divided by (1 − TEF_SHARE), not multiplied by (1 + TEF_SHARE).
 *
 * The goal factor is relative rather than a fixed offset: 500 kcal is a third of a 1500 kcal
 * budget and a sixth of a 3000 kcal one.
 *
 * Two floors then apply — never below the basal rate, never below the absolute intake
 * minimum. Whenever one binds, `safetyAdjustment` is non-zero and the UI has to explain it;
 * otherwise the target stops responding to input for no visible reason.
 *
 * Incomplete workouts are skipped, not rejected. Training is optional, so a started but
 * unfinished entry must neither contribute nor fail.
